01_Hello_World
==============

An introduction of myself so you will know a little about me.

I have learned that what we say and do is colored by who we are.

For example, when I first started learning about the science of Quality as taught
by W. Edwards Deming, I often encountered some ideas that I knew I wasn't getting
his point. So, I started to learn a little about W. Edwards Deming.

I learned that he had a Ph.D. in theoretical physics and studied physics during 
a time when quantum mechanics was just being born. I realized that this perspective
was very important so I started to study the point-of-view of quantum mechanics.

As I learned a little, I started to see more clearly the points Dr. Deming was
trying to make.

So here are a few key points about me:
* I grew up on a farm in Tridell, a small eastern Utah town.
* One of my hobbies as a young man was training horses so people could ride them.
* Another hobby was riding my horses into the Uinta mountains after chores were done.
* I have been an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life.
* I served in the U.S. Army from 1968 to 1970, during the Vietnam conflict.
* I was a missionary in South Korea from 1971 to 1973. I loved the time in South Korea and the wonderful people.
* I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Texas A&M University with a lot of background in math and statistics.
* I have spent the majority of my career in the Aerospace Defense industry as a process improvement engineer.
* I have been using Stata since its beginning in 1986 and I am learning R.
* I have been married for 40 years, Debbie and I have 9 children (last two adopted)
* We have 13 grandsons and 9 granddaughters. (Picture is Alec, Zoe and Myia riding my horse Foxy with me.)
* I am currently employed as the Continuous Improvement Manager at International Paperbox in Salt Lake City, Utah
 
### My goals related to this repository are to learn from you and share with you so that we all can be edified.
